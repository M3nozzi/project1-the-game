## About 

My initial ideia is to honor the great game Cuphead, so i used this thematic, although the objective of this game is just survive with the cuphead character as long as you can.
If the character get a coin, he receives +1 to his health, that's starts with 10. If the character is hit by a stone, he will lose -3 from his health.
During the game it will always appear an enemy to hinder the player. There is no damage from the enemy, he's there just to hamper and the game be a little bit difficult.

This project is a part of my Web Development Boootcamp at IronHack Brazil. 

## How to play

The objective of the game is keep playing as long as you can, to help the character survive the rainy rocks.

The player can use the keyboard with the commands: A - to move LEFT
                                                   D - to move RIGHT
                                                   [space] - to Start

It's possible to use the mouse too, that's why i put the butttons LEFT, RIGHT and START.
